# Dremio Cloud Tools

This repository contains tools and utilities to deploy Dremio to cloud environments:

* [Dockerfile](images/dremio-oss) to build Dremio Docker images.
* [Helm chart](charts/dremio_v2) to deploy Dremio to Kubernetes.
* [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template](azure/arm-templates) to deploy to Azure.

These are currently *experimental* items and should be evaluated and extended based on individual needs.
