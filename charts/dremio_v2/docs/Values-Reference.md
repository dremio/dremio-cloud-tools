# `Values.yaml` Reference

🔎 To search this document for specific values, use dot-notation to search, i.e. `coordinator.volumeSize`.

ℹ️ In all code examples, `[...]` denotes additional values that have been omitted.

## Top Level Values

### Image Configuration

#### `image`

Type: String

By default, the image is set to `dremio/dremio-oss`, the community edition of Dremio.

The `image` refers to the location to retrieve the specific container image for Dremio. In some cases, the `image` value may vary in corporate environments where there may be a private container registry that is used.

#### `imageTag`

Type: String

By default, the value is set to `latest`.

It is **strongly** recommended to pin the version of Dremio that we are deploying by setting the `imageTag` to a precise version and not leave the value as latest. Since Dremio versions are not backwards compatible, leaving it as latest may automatically upgrade dremio during pod creation.

#### `imagePullSecrets`

Type: Array

By default, this value is not set.

In some environments, an internal mirror may be used that requires authentication. For enterprise users, you may need to specify the `imagePullSecret` for the Kubernetes cluster to have access to the Dremio enterprise image. Please refer to the documentation [Pull an Image from a Private Repository](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) provided by Kubernetes on how to create an image pull secret.


### Kubernetes Service Account

#### `serviceAccount`

Type: String

By default, this value is not set and will use the default service account configured for the Kubernetes cluster.

This value is independently overridable in each section ([`coordinator`](#coordinator), [`executor`](#executor), [`zookeeper`](#zookeeper)).

More Info: See the [Service Accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) documentation for Kubernetes.

### Storage Configuration

#### `storageClass`

Type: String

By default, this value is not set and will use the default storage class configured for the Kubernetes cluster.

Storage class has a direct impact on the performance of the Dremio cluster. Optionally set this value to use the same storage class for all persistent volumes created. This value is independently overridable in each section ([`coordinator`](#coordinator), [`executor`](#executor), [`zookeeper`](#zookeeper)).

More Info: See the [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) documentation for Kubernetes.

```yaml
extraStartParams: >-
  -DsomeTestKey=someValue
[...]
```

#### `extraInitContainers`

Type: String

By default, this value is not set.

This value controls additional `initContainers` that are started as part of the initialization process for Dremio's pods. The value specified here may reference values specified in the built-in `Values` object in Helm.

For example, to have an `initContainer` with the Dremio image, you can specify the following:

```yaml
extraInitContainers: |
  - name: dremio-hello-world
    image: {{ $.Values.image }}:{{ $.Values.imageTag }}
    command: ["echo", "Hello World"]
[...]
```

#### `extraVolumes`

Type: Array

By default, this value is not set.

This value controls additional volumes that are attached to the Dremio's pods. This specifies additional volumes that should be mountable to the containers in Dremio's pods. This value is typically used in conjunction with `extraVolumeMounts`.

For example, if you have a `ConfigMap` named  `cm-dremio-additional-files` with additional files that you want to include in the running Dremio pods, you can specify the following:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
- name: dremio-additional-files
  configMap:
    name: cm-dremio-additional-files
[...]
```

#### `extraVolumeMounts`

Type: Array

By default, this value is not set.

This value controls the additional volumes that should be mounted to the Dremio containers and the paths that each volume should be mounted at. This value is typically used in conjunction with `extraVolumes`.

For example, if you have set the above `extraVolumes` value as shown in the example, you can map this volume into the path `/additional-files` as follows:

```yaml
extraVolumeMounts:
- name: dremio-additional-files
  mountPath: "/additional-files"
[...]
```

## Coordinator Values

### General Configuration

#### `coordinator.cpu` & `coordinator.memory`

Type: Integer

By default, the value of `cpu` is `15` and the value of memory is `122800` (MB).

The values for `cpu` and `memory` control the amount of CPU and memory in MB being requested for each coordinator instance for the purposes of scheduling a coordinator to a specific node in the Kubernetes cluster.

***Note***: While the values specified are not upper bounds, the value of `memory` specified here is used by the chart to calculate the allocation of heap and direct memory used by Dremio.

#### `coordinator.count`

Type: Integer

By default, the value is set to `0`.

Increasing this number controls the *secondary* coordinators that are launched as part of the deployment. Regardless of this value, at minimum one master coordinator is launched as part of the deployment. The total number of coordinator instances launched will always be `coordinator.count + 1`.

#### `coordinator.volumeSize`

Type: String

By default, the value is set to `128Gi`.

The coordinator volume is used to store the RocksDB KV store and requires a performant disk. In most hosted Kubernetes environments, disk performance is determined by the size of the volume.

### Web UI

#### `coordinator.web.port`

Type: Integer

By default, the value is set to `9047`.

To change the port that Dremio listens on, change the port to a desired value. The valid range of ports is 1 to 65535.

#### `coordinator.web.tls.enabled`

Type: Boolean

By default, the value is set to `false`.

To enable TLS on the web UI, set this value to `true`. Also, provide a value for `coordinator.web.tls.secret` that corresponds with the TLS secret that should be used.

#### `coordinator.web.tls.secret`

Type: String

By default, the value is set to `dremio-tls-secret-ui`.

This value is ignored if `coordinator.web.tls.enabled` is not set to `true`. This value should reference the TLS secret object in Kubernetes that contains the certificate for the client JDBC/ODBC connections.

For example, to have TLS enabled for the web UI using a certificate created called `dremio-tls-secret-ui`, you can set the configuration as follows:

```yaml
coordinator:
  [...]
  web:
    tls:
      enabled: true
      secret: dremio-tls-secret-ui
[...]
```

To create a secret, use the following command: `kubectl create secret tls ${TLS_SECRET_NAME} --key ${KEY_FILE} --cert ${CERT_FILE}` providing appropriate values for `TLS_SECRET_NAME`, `KEY_FILE`, `CERT_FILE`.

***Note***: Dremio does not support auto-rotation of secrets. To update the secret used by Dremio, restart the coordinator pods to have the new TLS secret take effect.

More Info: See the [Creating your own Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-your-own-secrets) section of the Secrets documentation for Kubernetes.

### Client (JDBC/ODBC)

#### `coordinator.client.tls.enabled`

Type: Boolean

By default, the value is set to `false`. This is an **enterprise only feature** and should not be set to true when using a community edition of Dremio.

To enable TLS on the client ODBC/JDBC port, set this value to `true`. Also, provide a value for `coordinator.client.tls.secret` that corresponds with the TLS secret that should be used.

#### `coordinator.client.tls.secret`

Type: String

By default, the value is set to `dremio-tls-secret-client`.

This value is ignored if `coordinator.client.tls.enabled` is not set to `true`. This value should reference the TLS secret object in Kubernetes that contains the certificate for the client JDBC/ODBC connections.

For example, to have TLS enabled for the client JDBC/ODBC connections using a certificate created called `dremio-tls-secret-client`, you can set the configuration as follows:

```yaml
coordinator:
  [...]
  client:
    tls:
      enabled: true
      secret: dremio-tls-secret-client
[...]
```

To create a secret, use the following command: `kubectl create secret tls ${TLS_SECRET_NAME} --key ${KEY_FILE} --cert ${CERT_FILE}` providing appropriate values for `TLS_SECRET_NAME`, `KEY_FILE`, `CERT_FILE`.

***Note***: Dremio does not support auto-rotation of secrets. To update the secret used by Dremio, restart the coordinator pods to have the new TLS secret take effect.

More Info: See the [Creating your own Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-your-own-secrets) section of the Secrets documentation for Kubernetes.

### Flight

#### `coordinator.flight.tls.enabled`

Type: Boolean

By default, the value is set to `false`.

To enable TLS on the Flight port, set this value to `true`. Also, provide a value for `coordinator.flight.tls.secret` that corresponds with the TLS secret that should be used.

#### `coordinator.flight.tls.secret`

Type: String

By default, the value is set to `dremio-tls-secret-flight`.

This value is ignored if `coordinator.flight.tls.enabled` is not set to `true`. This value should reference the TLS secret object in Kubernetes that contains the certificate for the Flight connections.

For example, to have TLS enabled for the Flight connections using a certificate created called `dremio-tls-secret-flight`, you can set the configuration as follows:

```yaml
coordinator:
  [...]
  flight:
    tls:
      enabled: true
      secret: dremio-tls-secret-flight
[...]
```

To create a secret, use the following command: `kubectl create secret tls ${TLS_SECRET_NAME} --key ${KEY_FILE} --cert ${CERT_FILE}` providing appropriate values for `TLS_SECRET_NAME`, `KEY_FILE`, `CERT_FILE`.

***Note***: Dremio does not support auto-rotation of secrets. To update the secret used by Dremio, restart the coordinator pods to have the new TLS secret take effect.

## Executor Values

### General Configuration

#### `executor.cpu` & `executor.memory`

Type: Integer

By default, the value of `cpu` is `15` and the value of memory is `122800` (MB). This value can be set on a **per-engine basis**, see the [Per-Engine Configuration](#per-engine-configuration) section.

The values for `cpu` and `memory` control the amount of CPU and memory in MB being requested for each executor instance for the purposes of scheduling an executor to a specific node in the Kubernetes cluster.

***Note***: While the values specified are not upper bounds, the value of `memory` specified here is used by the chart to calculate the allocation of heap and direct memory used by Dremio.

#### `executor.engines`

Type: Array

By default, the value is `["default"]`.

By adding additional values to this list, additional sets of executors are launched. By default, each set of executors will start with `executor.count` number of pods. See the Per-Engine Overrides section of this reference to customize the number of executors are started.

#### `executor.count`

Type: Integer

By default, the value is set to `3`. This value can be set on a **per-engine basis**, see the [Per-Engine Configuration](#per-engine-configuration) section.

Increasing this number controls the number of executors that are launched as part of the engine. Without per-engine overrides, the total number of executor pods started is calulated as the `length(executor.engines) * executor.count`.

#### `executor.volumeSize`

Type: String

By default, the value is set to `128Gi`. This value can be set on a **per-engine basis**, see the [Per-Engine Configuration](#per-engine-configuration) section.

The executor volume is used to store results of queries run. If the `distStore.type` is set to `local`, additional resources such as accelerations may be stored in the volume. In most hosted Kubernetes environments, disk performance is determined by the size of the volume.

### Columnar Cloud Cache (C3) Configuration

#### `executor.cloudCache.enabled`

Type: Boolean

By default, the value is set to `true`. This value can be set on a **per-engine basis**, see the [Per-Engine Configuration](#per-engine-configuration) section.

Columnar cloud cache (C3) is enabled by default on executors. To turn off cloud cache, set this value to `false`.

#### `executor.cloudCache.storageClass`

Type: String

By default, this value is not set. If this value is omitted or set to an empty string, this value will be inherited from `executor.storageClass` or its parent value `storageClass`. This value can be set on a **per-engine basis**, see the [Per-Engine Configuration](#per-engine-configuration) section.

C3 is designed for usage with local NVMe storage devices. If available, it is recommended to setup a [local storage provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) to allow Dremio to utilize local NVMe storage on the Kubernetes nodes.

#### `executor.cloudCache.volumes`

Type: Array

By default, the value is set to `[{size: 100Gi}]`. This value can be set on a **per-engine basis**, see the [Per-Engine Configuration](#per-engine-configuration) section.

By specifying more than one item in the list, additional volumes are provisioned for C3. Each volume must specify a `size` and optionally a  `name` and custom  `storageClass`. If the volume omits the `storageClass`, the value of `executor.cloudCache.storageClass` or its parent values are used.

For example, if the Kubernetes nodes that are provisioned have three local NVMe storage devices available, then we can create three C3 cache volumes each using a different `size` and combination of custom `name` and `storageClass` values:

```yaml
executor:
  [...]
  cloudCache:
    volumes:
    - size: 300Gi
    - name: "executor-c3-0"
      size: 100Gi
      storageClass: "local-nvme"
    - size: 50Gi
      storageClass: "local-nvme"
[...]
```

  - name: dremio-additional-files
    configMap:
      name: cm-dremio-additional-files
[...]
```

More Info: Refer to the [`extraVolumes`](#extravolumes) section of this reference.

#### `executor.extraVolumeMounts`

Type: Array

By default, this value is not set. If this value is omitted or set to an empty array, this value will be inherited from the top level `extraVolumeMounts`. This value can be set on a **per-engine basis**, see the [Per-Engine Configuration](#per-engine-configuration) section.

This value controls the additional volumes that should be mounted to the Dremio executor container and the paths that the volume should be mounted at. This value is typically used in conjunction with `executor.extraVolumes`.

For example, if you have set the above `executor.extraVolumes` value as shown in the example, you can map this volume into the path `/additional-files` as follows:

```yaml
executor:
  [...]
  extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: dremio-additional-files
    mountPath: "/additional-files"
[...]
```

More Info: Refer to the [`extraVolumeMounts`](#extravolumemounts) section of this reference.

### Per-Engine Configuration

#### `executor.engineOverride.<engine-name>`

Type: Dictionary

By default, this value is not set.

Engine overrides use the name of the engine provided in the `executor.engines` array to allow customization on a per-engine basis. The value of `<engine-name>` should be the name of an engine provided in `executor.engines`.

For example, the following shows all the supported override values being set (which override the shared values from `executor`):

```yaml
executor:
  [...]
  engineOverride:
    <engine-name>:
      cpu: 4
      memory: 144800

      count: 2

      annotations:
        example-annotation-one: "example-value-one"
        example-annotation-two: "example-value-two"
      podAnnotations:
        example-pod-annotation-one: "example-value-one"
        example-pod-annotation-two: "example-value-two"
      labels:
        example-label-one: "example-value-one"
        example-label-two: "example-value-two"
      podLabels:
        example-pod-label-one: "example-value-one"
        example-pod-label-two: "example-value-two"
      nodeSelector:
        diskType: "ssd"
      tolerations:
      - key: "example-key"
        operator: "Exists"
        effect: "NoSchedule"

      serviceAccount: "internal"

      extraStartParams: >-
        -DsomeTestKey=someValue

      extraInitContainers: |
        - name: dremio-hello-world
          image: {{ $.Values.image }}:{{ $.Values.imageTag }}
          command: ["echo", "Hello World"]

      extraVolumes:
      - name: dremio-additional-files
        configMap:
          name: cm-dremio-additional-files

      extraVolumeMounts:
      - name: dremio-additional-files
        mountPath: "/additional-files"

      volumeSize: 50Gi
      storageClass: "managed-premium"

      cloudCache:
        enabled: true

        storageClass: "local-nvme"

        volume:
        - size: 300Gi
        - name: "executor-c3-0"
          size: 100Gi
          storageClass: "local-nvme"
        - size: 50Gi
          storageClass: "local-nvme"
[...]
```

#### `executor.engineOverride.<engine-name>.volumeClaimName`

Type: String

By default, this value is not set.

When set, this will be the volume claim name used for the peristent volume by an engine. Unless moving from an old Helm chart with existing volume claims that must be retained, this value should not be used. This value should only be used for the `default` engine as persistent volume claims are pod name dependent as well and non-`default` engines will not match the pod name required.

For example, if moving from an old Helm chart that used `dremio-executor-volume`, you can continue to use the volumes for the `default` engine by specifying the following:

```yaml
executor:
  [...]
  engineOverride:
    default:
      volumeClaimName: dremio-executor-volume
[...]
```

## Distributed Storage Values

## Storage Values

### General Configuration

#### `service.type`

Type: String

By default, this value is set to `LoadBalancer`.

In some environments, a `LoadBalancer` may not be available. You may alternatively set the type to `ClusterIP` for cluster-only usage of Dremio or `NodePort` to make the service available via the port on the Kubernetes node.

For example, to make Dremio only accessible in the Kubernetes cluster, you can do the following:

```yaml
service:
  [...]
  type: ClusterIP
[...]
```

#### `service.sessionAffinity`

Type: Boolean

By default, this value is not set, which defaults to `false`.

To enable session affinity, set this value to `ClientIP`. Session affinity is critical for the web UI when there `coordinator.count` is greater than 0.

If utilizing Flight, please see [Important Setup Considerations](https://github.com/dremio/dremio-cloud-tools/blob/master/charts/dremio_v2/docs/setup/Important-Setup-Considerations.md) for more information about enabling session affinity.

### Annotations and Labels

By default, these values are not set. If the value is omitted or set to an empty array/dictionary, this value will be inherited from the top level equivalent. For more information about these configuration values, please refer to the top level equivalents of these values.

#### `service.annotations`

Type: Dictionary

The annotations set are used by the `Service` resource.

For example, you can set annotations as follows:

```yaml
service:
  [...]
  annotations:
    example-annotation-one: "example-value-one"
[...]
```

More Info: Refer to the [`annotations`](#annotations) section of this reference.

#### `service.labels`

Type: Dictionary

The labels set are used by the `Service` resource.

For example, you can set labels as follows:

```yaml
coordinator:
  [...]
  labels:
    example-label-one: "example-value-one"
[...]
```

More Info: Refer to the [`labels`](#labels) section of this reference.

### Load Balancer

#### `service.internalLoadBalancer`

Type: Boolean

By default, this value is not set, which defaults to `false`.

When enabling this property, additional annotations are added to the pod for using an internal IP for the load balancer. Specifically, the following annotations are added which provide support for AWS, AKS, and GKE load balancers:

- `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"`
- `cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "Internal"`
- `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: 0.0.0.0/0`

If these values are not applicable for your Kubernetes cluster, use the [`service.annotations`](#serviceannotations) value to provide a custom annotation that applies to your load balancer.

#### `service.loadBalancerIP`

Type: String

By default, this value is not set.

When setting this property, the load balancer attempts to use the provided IP address instead of dynamically allocating one. This IP address should be a static IP address that is usable by Kubernetes.

## Zookeeper Values

### Image Configuration

#### `zookeeper.image`

Type: String

By default, the value is set to `k8s.gcr.io/kubernetes-zookeeper`.

The `image` refers to the location to retrieve the specific container image for Zookeeper. In some cases, the `zookeeper.image` value may vary in corporate environments where there may be a private container registry that is used.

#### `zookeeper.imageTag`

Type: String

By default, the value is set to `1.0-3.4.10`.

The version of Zookeeper set has been validated by Dremio to work with the Dremio software. Changing this version is not recommended unless the tag is different due to a private container registry name difference.

### General Configuration

#### `zookeeeper.cpu` & `zookeeper.memory`

Type: Integer

By default, the value of `cpu` is `0.5` and the value of memory is `1024` (MB).

The values for `cpu` and `memory` control the amount of CPU and memory in MB being requested for each Zookeeper instance for the purposes of scheduling a Zookeeper to a specific node in the Kubernetes cluster.

#### `zookeeper.count`

Type: Integer

By default, the value is set to `3`.

This number sets the number of instances of Zookeeper to deploy. It is recommended to have a minimum of 3 to maintain a quorum. Changing the value below 3 may cause instability in the cluster.

#### `zookeeper.volumeSize`

Type: String

By default, the value is set to `10Gi`.

The Zookeeper volume is used for the WAL (Write Ahead Log) used by Zookeeper in the event of a crash.

### Annotations, Labels, Node Selectors, Tags, and Tolerations

By default, these values are not set. If the value is omitted or set to an empty array/dictionary, this value will be inherited from the top level equivalent. For more information about these configuration values, please refer to the top level equivalents of these values.

#### `zookeeper.annotations`

Type: Dictionary

The annotations set are used by the Zookeeper `StatefulSet` resource.

For example, you can set annotations as follows:

```yaml
zookeeper:
  [...]
  annotations:

  [...]
  podAnnotations:
    example-pod-annotation-one: "example-value-one"
[...]
```

More Info: Refer to the [`podAnnotations`](#podannotations) section of this reference.

#### `zookeeper.labels`

Type: Dictionary

The labels set are used by the Zookeeper `StatefulSet` .

For example, you can set labels as follows:

```yaml
zookeeper:
  [...]
  labels:
    example-label-one: "example-value-one"
[...]
```

More Info: Refer to the [`labels`](#labels) section of this reference.

#### `zookeeper.podLabels`

Type: Dictionary

The pod labels set are used by all  `Pod`(s) created by the Zookeeper `StatefulSet`.

For example, you can set pod labels as follows:

```yaml
zookeeper:
  [...]
  podLabels:
    example-pod-label-one: "example-value-one"
[...]
```

More Info: Refer to the [`podLabels`](#podlabels) section of this reference.

#### `zookeeper.nodeSelector`

Type: Array

The node selectors set are used by all `Pod`(s) created by the Zookeeper `StatefulSet`.

    diskType: "ssd"
[...]
```

More Info: Refer to the [`nodeSelector`](#nodeselector) section of this reference.

### Advanced Customizations

#### `zookeeper.storageClass`

Type: String

By default, this value is not set. If this value is omitted or set to an empty string, this value will be inherited from the top level `storageClass`.

Storage class has an impact on the performance of the Zookeeper instances when writing the WAL and reading back data in the event of a crash. A more performant storage class may impact recovery times in the event of such a crash.

More Info: Refer to the [`storageClass`](#storageclass) section of this reference.

#### `zookeeper.serviceAccount`

Type: String
