# The Dremio image used in the cluster.
#
# It is *highly* recommended to update the version tag to
# the version that you are using. This will ensure that all
# the pods are using the same version of the software. If
# you are directly consuming Dremio's images from Docker Hub,
# when specifying which version to use, it is best to use the
# full version tag in the form X.Y.Z (i.e. 21.1.0), as image
# tags in the form X.Y (i.e. 21.1) are updated with the latest
# patch version released.
#
# Using the image tag latest or in the form X.Y
# will potentially cause Dremio to upgrade versions
# automatically during redeployments and may negatively impact
# the cluster.
